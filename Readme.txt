# MFNet for dMRI Cell-Type ClassificationThis repository provides PyTorch implementations for training and evaluating deep learning models on **diffusion MRI (dMRI)?based cell type classification tasks**.  It supports three main settings:1. E and I classification2. Neighborhood classification3. Class classification---Repository Structure- **`network17.py`**    Model architectures:  - `MAFNet` ? multi-scale CNN + Transformer fusion.    - `Simple1DCNN` ? baseline 1D CNN.- **`data_loader.py`**    Dataset utilities for different CSV layouts and coordinate normalization.- **Training Scripts**  - **E vs I classification**    - `train_E.py` ? ABA dataset, binary E/I.      - `train_2class_E_high_wight.py` ? binary E/I with class weighting.      - `train_E_10um_testing.py` ? E/I testing on 10 ?m grouped data.  - **Neighborhood classification (7 classes) ¡ú easily extensible to class/subtype classification**  - `train_E_7_ABA.py` ? trains a 7-class Neighborhood classifier on ABA E-cells.  - `train_E_neighborhood_10um_data.py` ? trains on ABA (Neighborhood) and transfers to 10 ?m data (works for E or I).These pipelines are **plug-compatible** with class/subtype labels: switch the label column and class names, and you¡¯re done.  - **Subtype/class classification**    - Extendable with the same architecture (`network17.py`) and data loaders;
